            <p>
                Growing up, I was exposed to various forms of video such as YouTube, television, and film, which sparked my interest in the video creation process. 
                With my passion for technology, I began studying and learning many video creation technologies. 
                Although I am focused on my career in computer science, I am always excited to take on new video creation projects. 
                As a freelancer, I have worked on a variety of projects including creating slideshows for formal events and countdown timers for online streams.

        <h2>My Viral Video</h2>
            <p>
                In 2019, I created a video inspired by the Avengers Endgame credits trend. 
                I chose Breaking Bad as my subject since I had recently seen it and nobody else had attempted it at the time. 
                A few days after uploading the video to YouTube, it had gained over 200 views, which was a surprise for me since I had never uploaded a video to my channel before. 
                The video continued to attract viewers and has now amassed over 19,000 views.
