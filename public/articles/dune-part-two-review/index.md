My Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I had the pleasure of attending an early screening of *Dune: Part Two*, and here's my review along with some thoughts that slightly diminished the experience.

# Review
I whole heartedly loved this movie. It achieves everything it sets out to do, and secures its place as one of the greatest Sci-Fi films ever made. The performances, espcially Timothée Chalamet's, were outstanding. I had doubts that he would be able to live up to certain things that the Paul Atreides role demanded, but he squashed those and solidified his status as one of the best in the business. The entire cast delivered excellent performances, and are all deserving of the praises they will undoubtedly receive. The sets and costume designs were exceptional. They were so good that I was sometimes distracted by the environment from the story itself. The music and sound design, being Hans Zimmer, was predictably phenomenal.

## Recommendation
If you enjoyed *Dune: Part One*, you'll enjoy this one just as much or more. For those who haven't seen the first part, it is a must watch before watching the second. Admittedly, there will be plenty of people who won't like these movies to the extend I did. These movies cater to adults who like Sci-Fi, and do not shy away from that. Both films may be challenging for those not wired for the genre, and whilst they might still enjoy them, they may not fully grasp their depth.

# My Problem
Before I delve into my issues with *Dune: Part Two*, I have to give a little bit of history on my experience with the Dune franchise.

I developed an interest *Dune* due to my love for *Star Wars*, and the influence *Dune* had on George Lucas's creation. Despite this, I hadn't engaged with anything Dune until *Dune: Part One* was released. I found the first film a bit slow (an issue I didn't have with Part Two) but enjoyed it nonetheless. I purchased the book soon after, and despite its heaviness, loved every second of it. Going into *Dune: Part Two*, I expected there would be changes, similarly to how *Dune: Part One* had noticeable differences to the book, but wasn't prepared for what awaited me.

Usually I appreciate adaptations diverging from the source material, because I find lots of value in providing lifelong fans something new to explore in the world they love, while enticing new fans to discover the original works of a world they come to love. With that being said, *Dune: Part Two* left me slightly disappointed. Without revealing specifics for potential readers who haven't read the book or seen the film, it omits many of my favorite elements in the book. This doesn't diminish the film's merits, because it is a great story with a superb cast and breathtaking visuals, but there was so much that I wanted to see which I did not get to. I don't think I've ever left a theater loving a film and simultaneously being disappointed in it. It's a very strange feeling. I am yet to watch the original Dune film and miniseries', so it's possible I'll get to see those elements realized soon, but it certainly won't live up to the quality of *Dune: Part Two*.

I'll be watching *Dune: Part Two* again in a few days, optimistic that I can embrace the differences and fully enjoy this incredible film without dwelling on the deviations from the book. Because as Brain Herbert wrote in his afterword for *Dune*:

> We can always go back to *Dune* itself and read it again and again.
