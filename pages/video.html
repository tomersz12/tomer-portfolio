            <p>
                Growing up, I was exposed to various forms of video such as YouTube, television, and film, which sparked my interest in the video creation process. 
                With my passion for technology, I began studying and learning many video creation technologies. 
                Although I am focused on my career in computer science, I am always excited to take on video creation projects. 
                As a freelancer, I have worked on a variety of projects including creating slideshows for formal events and countdown timers for online streams.
